INTRODUCTION:

An infrared sensor is an electronic instrument which is used to sense certain characteristics of its surroundings by either 
emitting and/or detecting infrared radiation. Infrared sensors are also capable of measuring the heat being emitted by an object 
and detecting motion. In this project, we interface a IR sensor with an LPC 1768 ARM Microcontroller to detect the distance of an
object from the sensor. The aim of this project is -

- To comprehend the software development for ARM cortex-M microcontroller using embedded C language.
- To understand various interfacing circuits necessary for various applications and programming using ARM.
- To learn how to configure an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) to convert analog input from a IR sensor and display it in 
  digital format with the help of an LCD.
  
 
SHARP IR SENSOR:
The GP2Y0A21 Sharp distance sensor is a great way to add obstacle avoidance or motion sensing to your robot or any other project.
It has a detection range of 4′′ to 32′′ (10cm to 80cm) and an analog voltage indicating the distance.

- Operating voltage: 4.5 V to 5.5 V
- Average current consumption: 30 mA (note: this sensor draws current in large, short bursts, and the manufacturer recommends 
  putting a 10 μF capacitor or larger across power and ground close to the sensor to stabilize the power supply line)
- Distance measuring range: 10 cm to 80 cm (4′′ to 32′′)
- Output type: analog voltage
- Output voltage differential over distance range: 1.9 V (typical)
- Update period: 38 ± 10 ms
- Size: 44.5 mm × 18.9 mm × 13.5 mm (1.75′' × 0.75′′ × 0.53′′)
- Weight: 3.5 g (0.12 oz)
